#tools

in side of these folder contain the important analysis code used for my phd work, although still a mess now, I plan to do several things to make it more reusable in future. 
The purpose of this, is to build a toolbox for myself. 

Here are several things need to be done: 

1. write on each file, the purpose of the code, how to use it 
2. try to improve the code to make it more universal, and classify the universal version code and specific version of code. 
2.1 For the specific version of code, make it clear which situation it used for
3. write down how to use each code and several code to achieve something( like the workflow) 
4. use https://www.jianshu.com/p/8b6c425b65a6 （代码规范） to make my code more clear to others
